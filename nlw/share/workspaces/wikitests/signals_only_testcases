* Fixture: SocialWidgets

This testset tests the Signals Only configuration: dashboard disabled, signals enabled, no wikis other than Help wikis.

It will delete all the standard wikis from a dev env and devnull1 member from help-en and help-adminguide
Since it will delete all wikis, the plan server and plan workspace must be in a different running environment.

To use this testset:

`export SELENIUM_PLAN_SERVER=http://$PLAN_SERVER:$PLAN_PORT`
`cdcur; source nlw/dev-bin/sotc`

for example:

.pre
export SELENIUM_PLAN_SERVER=<http://talc.socialtext.net:22004> (plan server and workspace is from talc:22004)
sudo su - qa1 (Signals Only dev env is user qa1 dev env, talc:22201)
cdcur
source nlw/dev-bin/sotc
.pre

sotc will `run-wiki-tests --plan-page signals_only_testcases` using the plan server and workspace, thus executing this page:

NOTE: each of these test must manage its own plugin enables/disables, logins and logouts independently so order is not significant
